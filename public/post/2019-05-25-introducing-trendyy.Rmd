```

`trendyy` is a package for querying Google Trends. It is build around [Philippe Massicotte](https://github.com/PMassicotte)'s package [`gtrendsR`](https://github.com/PMassicotte/gtrendsR) which accesses this data wonderfully.

The inspiration for this package was to provide a tidy interface to the trends data.


## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install `trendyy` from CRAN using `install.packages("trendyy")`.

### Usage

Use `trendy()` to search Google Trends. The only mandatory argument is `search_terms`. This is a character vector with the terms of interest. It is important to note that Google Trends is only capable of comparing up to five terms. Thus, if your `search_terms` vector is longer than 5, it will search each term individually. This will remove the direct comparative advantage that Google Trends gives you.

#### Additional arguments

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601_2x.png)

- `from`: The beginning date of the query in `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format.
- `to`: The end date of the query in `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format.
- `...` : any additional arguments that would be passed to `gtrendsR::gtrends()`. Note that it might be useful to indicate the geography of interest. See `gtrendsR::countries` for list of possible geographies. 

#### Accessor Functions

- `get_interest()`: Retrieve interest over time
- `get_interest_city()`:	Retrieve interest by city
- `get_interest_country()`:	Retrieve interest by country
- `get_interest_dma()`:	Retrieve interest by DMA
- `get_interest_region()`:	Retrieve interest by region
- `get_related_queries()`:	Retrieve related queries
- `get_related_topics()`:	Retrieve related topics


## Example

Seeing as I found an interest in this due to the relatively pervasive use of Google Trends in political analysis, I will compare the top five polling candidates in the 2020 Democratic Primary. As of May 22nd, they were Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. 

First, I will create a vector of my desired search terms. Second, I will pass that vector to `trendy()` specifying my query date range from the first of 2019 until today (May 25th, 2019).


```{r}
candidates <- c("Joe Biden", "Kamala Harris", "Beto O'Rourke", "Bernie Sanders", "Elizabeth Warren")

candidate_trends <- trendy(candidates, from = "2019-01-01", to = Sys.Date())
```


Now that we have a trendy object, we can print it out to get a summary of the trends.

```{r}
candidate_trends
```

In order to retrieve the trend data, use `get_interest()`. Note, that this is dplyr friendly. 

```{r}
get_interest(candidate_trends)
```

### Plotting Interest

```{r}
candidate_trends %>% 
  get_interest() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date, hits, color = keyword)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "Relative Search Popularity",
       title = "Google Search Popularity")
```

It is also possible to view the related search queries for a given set of keywords using `get_related_queries()`. 

```{r}
candidate_trends %>% 
  get_related_queries() %>% 
  group_by(keyword) %>% 
  sample_n(2)
```
