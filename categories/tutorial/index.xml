      <description>My education as a social scientist—undergratuate studies in sociology and anthropology—was largely focused on theory and the application of theory to social problems. For the most part, I taught myself how to apply those methods through R. I was fortunate enough to have avoided ever using SPSS. Perhaps that is good. Perhaps it is not. The use of R in the social sciences is increasing and I will go as far as to say that that is great news.</description>

      <description>This small tutorial was developed for a talk / workshop that Phil Bowsher gave at the EPA. This serves as a quick example of using the tidyverse for spatial analysis, modeling, and interactive mapping.
The source code and data can be found here.
EPA Water Quality Analysis Data Cleaning This section outlines the process needed for cleaning data taken from EPA.gov.
There are two datasets:</description>

      <description>The Jargon The Generic Method The Default Method sf method tbl_graph method Review (tl;dr)   Lately I have been doing more of my spatial analysis work in R with the help of the sf package. One shapefile I was working with had some horrendously named columns, and naturally, I tried to clean them using the clean_names() function from the janitor package. But lo, an egregious error occurred. To this end, I officially filed my complaint as an issue.</description>

      <title>Chunking your csv</title>

      <description>Sometimes due to limitations of software, file uploads often have a row limit. I recently encountered this while creating texting campaigns using Relay. Relay is a peer-to-peer texting platform. It has a limitation of 20k contacts per texting campaign. This is a limitation when running a massive Get Out the Vote (GOTV) texting initiative.
In order to solve this problem, a large csv must be split into multiple csv’s for upload.</description>

      <title>Reading Multiple csvs as 1 data frame</title>

      <description>In an earlier posting I wrote about having to break a single csv into multiple csvs. In other scenarios one data set maybe provided as multiple a csvs.
Thankfully purrr has a beautiful function called map_df() which will make this into a two liner. This process has essentially 3 steps.
Create a vector of all .csv files that should be merged together. Read each file using readr::read_csv() Combine each dataframe into one.</description>

      <description>Over the past several weeks I have been helping students, career professionals, and people of other backgrounds learn R. During this time one this has become apparent, people are teaching the old paradigm of R and avoiding the tidyverse all together.
I recently had a student reach out to me in need of help with the first programming assignment from the Coursera R-Programming course (part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization).</description>
