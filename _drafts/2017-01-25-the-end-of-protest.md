## Quotes:
### Ch. 2: A Constructive Failure
 - > "We believed that nominally democratic governments would be swayed by a historic event that was mass, urban, non-violent, and unified." p. 25
 - > "...we maintained a theatrical view of activism that treats public space as the stage for a political spectacle." p.25
 - > "Occupy Wallstreet was a *constructive failure* but not a *total failure*." p. 26
 - > "Like Occupy, the anti-war movement vaproized when the theory of social change underlying the movement—that governments will bend if millions of people assemble in the streets, march and make a single demand— was proven ineffective." p.28

### Ch. 3: The End of Protest
 - > "Revolutionary movements do not succeed where only the workers are mobilized, or only the peasants, or only the middle classes. They succeed only when a critical mass of most or all of the major classes in the society is mobilized in the revolutionary process." p. 34
 - > "With the failure of Occupy we learned instead that these ritualized public spectacles of tens of thousands in the streets are only effective when applied against autocratic regimes that are vulnerable to international pressure." p. 36
 - > "We thoughts that no government could resist the united chorus of its citizens expressing themselves with demcratic fervour. That was the meaning o democracy. Not anymore." p. 39
   - Note: This was proven in 2014 Ukraine revolution (still ongoing).
 - > "The task of the next generation of protestors is to respond to the crisis by moving beyond critique and toward a developing a new paradimn that can replace the old." p. 42

### Ch. 5: I Am An Activist
 - > "...potential campaign issues where a small amount of pressure could yield exponential force." p. 47
   - Note: Seems that our current political system is not chaotic. However, there may be a way to enable (think a dummy variable) chaos within the body politic.
     - Meta-note: Chaos as in a chaotic system, not anarchy.

- > "The only way to really know for sure what causes a social revoluton to succeed is to provoke events and watch them flicker, fade of ignite." p.51

     - Successful protest is agile. Iteration is a counter to the slow nature of a bureaucracy (government), as protest can avoid formalities. Slowness is good though. Slowness is what allows laws to be enacted for the long run, and prevent them from being repealed quickly. Slowness in a bueaucracy protects rights and enables protest.

### Ch. 6: The Point of Protest

  - > "Activism is crucial to a healthy society because revolutions drive social progress." p. 54

    - Peaceful activism is a sign of a healthy democracy. I argue that it illustrates a body politic that is able to speak out for social change without fear of violent revolt. When peaceful activisim is enabled, legislators are, by virtue of a healthy democracy, reactive through dialogue and hopefully, legislature.
      - > *Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.* - J. F. Kennedy p. 54

  - > "Revolutions that come from the people, and wars started by governments, involve a similar process of ideological stimulation and social deprogramming designed to heal society through abnormal collective action." p. 58

    - Goal of revolution and protest is to prosperity of humanity. Revolution strives for a humanitarian end, though it shall never be achieved.

### Ch. 7: A Unified Theory of Revolution

  - > "A repressive status quo functions by promulgating broken theoriesof change, thereby disconnecting the link between protest and change so that our actions will fail and our time will be squandered." p. 72
  - > "...indicated six ... factors [that] had a significant impact on the success of protests groups. The factors were (1) bureaucratization, (2) centralization, (3) use of selective incentives, (4) use of violence, (5) recipience of violence, and (6) factionalism." p. 78
  - > "Revolution is impossible without a national crisis affecting both the exploted and the exploiters." - Lenin p.85

    - Increase in available capital for working class / proletariate leads to a more contented—or distracted—people.

  - > "But there is indeed a point in changing your thoughts about the world. Here you are changing the cause. The effect will change automatically." p.91

      - One's thought may change the meaning of an action, and thus the interpreation of the product. But simply thinking alone will not suffice as thought works on a micro, if not nano, scale.

  - > "The tools of magic—the understanding ... of symbols ... and of ways in which to shift and shape it—are also the tools of political and social change." -  Starhawk p.93

    - I often draw on the sociological theory of symbolic interactionism. I firmly believe that it may be at the root of all understanding. I find that symbols are understood almost entirely contextually and subject to much change. Therefore if one can change how a symbol is interpreted and have it spread as a meme, an entire society may change their conceptions of the symbol, effectively subverting hegemonic paradigmns.

### Ch. 8: The Recent Past of Protest

  - > "The Occupy movement, on the other hand, started with the demand of getting money out of politics but quickly devolved into so many generalized critiques that it ultimately appeared to be without concrete demands." p. 111

    - No protest can achieve much without a set of defined goals. Abstract goals such as "end ___-ism!" will rarely be achieved. I argue that this is because "-isms" lack a visage.

  - > "...social movements need a structure that gives credibility and permanence." p. 112

    - Before launching any movement, ensure that there is the requisite infrastructure to handle the end goal. If it does not exist, be prepared to institute it.

  - > "When using social media, activists should follow three rules: 'Never broadcast innacurate news, never conceal a defeat, never exaggerate a victory'." p. 131

    - Maintaining transparency is paramount to spearheading a grassroots movement. If there is any opportunity to delegitamize a movement be well aware that it will be exploited. Only one misgiving is all it takes to ruin a movement.

### Ch. 9: The Distant Past of Protest
  - > "The spread of Christianity owes its success to two high profile conversions, a rare celestial phenomenon and a theurigist symbol, not public protest and mass actions." p. 156

    - Rarely will any movement be successful without a stamp of approval from a well-recieved public figure. In addition it may take an act of divine intervention to catalyze the cause.

### Ch. 10: Mental Environmentalism

  - > "...it is the ecological struggle that has the greatest potential to unite humanity... either we all win or we all lose." p. 175

    - All resources are scarce and they will run out. For posterity, society ought to protest for the well being of the planet.

  - > "Environmentalism is first and foremost an existential and spiritual question. The ecological crisis is a matter of survival on the species level." p. 178

### Ch. 12: Three Scenarios

  - > "Protest is, after all, war by other means." p. 206

    - Supported by quote on p. 58.

### Ch. 15: Political Miracle
  - > "The way forward is an amalgamation of the four theories of revolution—structuralism, voluntarism, subjectivism, and theurgism—with an emphasis on targeting the mental environment, the collective imagination, in order to achieve socio-political change." p. 241

### Ch. 16: Prophecy of Protest

  - > "Revolutions, however, do happen and have happened many times in history. You are in the midst of one right now." p. 256

    - If we are always revolting, there will be no peace. This premise is self defeating. The question should no longer be of revolution, but of maintenance and adjustment.

_________

White's goal is a planetary peaceful democracy. Do I hear the start of a new Star Wars confederate? How can we maintain order of such a mass? Is the opportunity of protest and revolution a sign of a healthy democracy? It may help us heal our wounds without the need of a violent revolution. The sign of a healthy democracy is the ability to moderate the people via the people, not via authority.
