<div id="the-dilemma" class="section level2">
<h2>The Dilemma</h2>
<p>You could say my roommate and I are superheroes. We’re constantly saving the world from impending doom. We have a few superpowers, but our two strongest are recycling and reusing.</p>
<p>The other day in the face of rapidly increasing global temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events we were on our way to the local grocery store when we had a slip-up and forgot our conservationist equivalent to the batarang, our reusable canvas bag (thanks to <a href="https://subscribe.newyorker.com/subscribe/newyorker/109777?source=google_sem&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwlpbIBRCx4eT8l9W26igSJAAuQ_HGyzx5PbIhUEPn3nXvK3l57AHi3K5Rao4iys_BktFl-xoCDdfw_wcB">The New Yorker</a>).</p>
<p>“Bro!” I exclaimed. Tucker was startled and concerned. “We forgot our reusable bags. Should we go back and get them?” He sat there and thought for a second. He didn’t want to drive back. His car’s catalytic converter isn’t working at full capacity and he was concerned about his emissions.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “what would be worse? Us using plastic bags, or driving back just to get our reusable ones?” We sat there googling various things for a while, but soon gave up and went about our shopping. After all of our purchases we used only three plastic grocery bags.</p>
<p>This even has stuck with me and now, I am here to figure it out. <em>What would’ve been worse, driving back home to get our reusable bags, or using those three bags?</em> As the good empirical person I am I will use science (google) and R to solve this question.</p>
</div>
<div id="framing-the-question" class="section level2">
<h2>Framing the Question</h2>
<p>In order to solve this problem, I wanted to operationalize my previous use of the word <em>“worse”</em>. <em>Worse</em> is going to be measured in carbon dioxide emissions. I had a new research question.</p>
<p><strong>Research Question:</strong> <em>What would’ve made my carbon footprint smallest? Driving home to get our reusable bags, or using plastic grocery bags?</em></p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-the-data-say" class="section level2">
<h2>What do the data say?</h2>
<p>I started by evaluating the carbon footprint of my shopping bags. I first evaluated the carbon footprint of plastic. It turns out that the production and incernation of 1kg of plastic produces nearly 6kg of CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href="http://timeforchange.org/plastic-bags-and-plastic-bottles-CO2-emissions">1</a>), and each plastic grocery bag weights 5.5kg (<a href="https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=30162">2</a>). This means the total footprint for a bag is the CO<sub>2</sub> per kg, multiplied by total mass (in kg) of a grocery bag.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>footprint_kg &lt;- 6
bag_mass &lt;- 5.5

bag_footprint &lt;- footprint_kg * bag_mass
paste(&quot;Footprint per bag is&quot;, bag_footprint, &quot;kg.&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Footprint per bag is 33 kg.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Our total footprint would have been 99kg since we used three bags. However, since we are superheros, we recylce. By reclycing we reduced our footprint by 2.5kg (<a href="http://timeforchange.org/plastic-bags-and-plastic-bottles-CO2-emissions">1</a>). This changed our total output!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>footprint_kg &lt;- footprint_kg - 2.5

bag_footprint &lt;- footprint_kg * bag_mass
paste(&quot;Total footprint for 3 bags is&quot;, bag_footprint * 3, &quot;kg&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Total footprint for 3 bags is 57.75 kg&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next up to figure out was how much our we emitted on our car ride to the store and back for our complete footprint. To figure this out, I started by figuring out how much CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted per gallon and using that as a basis for the rest of my vehicular emission analysis. According to the US Energy Information Administration, a standard gallon of E10 gasoline (gasoline that contains 10% ethanol) produces 17.68 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=307&amp;t=11">3</a>). Next steps were to convert this to kgs, and figure out how many miles were driven to get groceries. There are <code>0.454</code> kgs in 1 pound (<a href="http://www.convertunits.com/from/lb/to/kg">4</a>) and according to Google maps, the grocery store was 1.7 miles away. I also assumed that my roommates car gets 20 miles to the gallon like he claims.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ethanol_emiss &lt;- 17.68 * 0.453592
gallons_one_way &lt;- 1.7/20
emiss_one_way &lt;- gallons_one_way * ethanol_emiss
paste(round(emiss_one_way, 3), &quot;kg of CO2 emitted in a one way trip&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;0.682 kg of CO2 emitted in a one way trip&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This calculation might be a little conservative due to the poor catalytic converter. Using my expert opinion, I decided that I could assume his vehicle emits 20% more than a standard car.</p>
<p>At this point, I was very close to figuring out which was <em>worse</em>, driving for the reusable bags, or using plastic grocery bags. My final steps were to find the total CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by my roommate and me plus our driving emissions, and compare it to our driving emissions plus our hypothetical drive back home.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Account for bad catalytic converter
emiss_one_way &lt;- emiss_one_way * 1.2

# Find my actual footprint
actual_footprint &lt;- bag_footprint * 3 + emiss_one_way * 2

# Find alternative footprint
alternative_footprint &lt;- emiss_one_way * 4

actual_footprint</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 59.38598</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>alternative_footprint</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.271959</code></pre>
<p>It is to my dismay that I let the earth down on that day. Had we driven back, we would have emitted 55 fewer kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>! I now know how important those reusable tote bags are. Reducing waste is a superpower we all can have, and I emplore you to use it!</p>
