      <description>Sometimes due to limitations of software, file uploads often have a row limit. I recently encountered this while creating texting campaigns using Relay. Relay is a peer-to-peer texting platform. It has a limitation of 20k contacts per texting campaign. This is a limitation when running a massive Get Out the Vote (GOTV) texting initiative.
In order to solve this problem, a large csv must be split into multiple csvâ€™s for upload.</description>

      <title>Reading Multiple csvs as 1 data frame</title>

      <description>In an earlier posting I wrote about having to break a single csv into multiple csvs. In other scenarios one data set maybe provided as multiple a csvs.
Thankfully purrr has a beautiful function called map_df() which will make this into a two liner. This process has essentially 3 steps.
Create a vector of all .csv files that should be merged together. Read each file using readr::read_csv() Combine each dataframe into one.</description>
