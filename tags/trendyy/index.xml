It is not uncommon to hear news about a candidates search trends the days following a town hall or significant rally. It seems that Google trends are becoming the go to proxy for a candidate’s salience.
As a campaign, you are interested in the popularity of a candidate relative to another one.</description>

      <description>trendyy is a package for querying Google Trends. It is build around Philippe Massicotte’s package gtrendsR which accesses this data wonderfully.
The inspiration for this package was to provide a tidy interface to the trends data.
Getting Started Installation You can install trendyy from CRAN using install.packages(&amp;quot;trendyy&amp;quot;).
 Usage Use trendy() to search Google Trends. The only mandatory argument is search_terms. This is a character vector with the terms of interest.</description>
