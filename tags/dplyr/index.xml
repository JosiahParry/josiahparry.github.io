      <description>My education as a social scientist—undergratuate studies in sociology and anthropology—was largely focused on theory and the application of theory to social problems. For the most part, I taught myself how to apply those methods through R. I was fortunate enough to have avoided ever using SPSS. Perhaps that is good. Perhaps it is not. The use of R in the social sciences is increasing and I will go as far as to say that that is great news.</description>
