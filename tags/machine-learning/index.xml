      <description>This is a resource intended to provide a top-level introduction into the main aspects of tidymodels. The introduction into tidyverse concepts largely adapted from Thomas Mock’s Intro to the Tidyverse. Content was also adapted from the Max Kuhn’s Applied Machine Learning content as well as Edgar Ruiz’s Gentle Introduction to Tidymodels.

      <description>This post will go over extracting feature (variable) importance and creating a function for creating a ggplot object for it. I will draw on the simplicity of Chris Albon’s post. For steps to do the following in Python, I recommend his post.
If you’ve ever created a decision tree, you’ve probably looked at measures of feature importance. In the above flashcard, impurity refers to how many times a feature was use and lead to a misclassification.</description>
