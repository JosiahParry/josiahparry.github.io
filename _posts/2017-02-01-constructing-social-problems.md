## Social Structure

A social structure is composed of individuals, groups, institutions and the relationships between them. For example, everyone in a classroom is related to eachother by the institution of the school. For every institution, it is presumed that there are rules governing these relationships. **Sociology can be thought of as the study of the rules that govern the relationships between individuals, groups, and institutions**. A *sociological theory* is an attempt to define those rules.

One question that arises for all phenomena is when does a phenomenon become a social problem? We can try to understand this by using a visualization.

```
+----+----+----+----+----+
|    |    |    |    |    |     # This is a social structure
+----+----+----+----+----+
|    |    |    |****|    |     # **** this is a phenomenon
+----+----+----+----+----+
|    |    |    |    |    |
+----+----+----+----+----+
```
<!--split-->
We ask: When does the phenomenon become a social problem? Where do you draw the line? Inherently there is a problem as the word *problem* is a value judgement. However we can define it as **a phenomenon regarded as bad or undesireable by a *significant* number of people who mobilize to alleviate it**. Another problem is the value judgement involved in the employment of the word **significant**.

Thus a visualization of a social problem might look like this:

```
+----+----+----+----+----+
|    |    |    |    |    |     # This is a social structure
+----+----+----+----+----+
|    |++++| -> |****|    |     # **** this is a phenomenon
+----+----+----+----+----+     # ++++ this is a social group
|    |    |    |    |    |
+----+----+----+----+----+
```
There is a group `++++` who is opposed to the phenomenon `****`. A sociologist cannot make the value judgement in saying that the phenomenon `****` is bad, but he can *objectively* say that a group `++++` says it is bad! Therefore the sociology of a social problem `****` requires the understanding of the group `++++` and the structure it is within.

### Discovery of Child Abuse (1950's)

Let us use the *discovery* of child abuse as an example of *"creating"* a social problem. First note that the term *discovery* implies that child abuse already existed. The 1950's saw improvements in radiology which was able to show long term sustained injury in bones which is a marker of child abuse. However, doctors already knew that child abuse was already happening within families. The dominant belief in the 1950's *social structure* was that children were property of their parents, and what happened behind close doors was nobody else's business. But what caused this *"discovery"*?

Let us look to radiologists. Radiologists at this time had quite low occupational presteige. They were viewed as tools, not solutions. Radiologists were not the ones who mended broken bones, but rather those who identified them. Radiologists, with their new developments in radiology, were able to boost their occupational presteige by *discovering* child abuse. Pediatric Radiologists were able to illustrate the injuries inflicted upon children, and declare them a problem within society.


As a note to the sociologist in training (like myself), always try to write without insuating that anything is bad, but by illustrating that a group of people believe it is bad via explaining individuals and their relationships to phenomena and structures. Look at the social structures, and how meaning is construted within it.
