title: Can you kindly shut up?
subtitle: My struggle trying to hear myself think.
---

I’m told that not moving your mouth to the words you are reading is the sign of a good reader. Good readers are able to recognize the symbols and interpret them directly without a second level of interaction.

I believe myself to be a competent reader. I read quickly and thoroughly, sometimes. I am one of those readers that moves their mouth to the words. Not to understand, but to hear them. I struggle with this. People can look at words on a page and read effortlessly. I am not this way. I put eyes to paper and I see the shape of the letters, arrangement of the words, distribution of the paragraphs, the font style and the kerning. I hear the words of the barista to my right, I hear the tap of the foot on barstool — a beat to a rhythm, a rhythm I want to hear — , I hear the low hum of the refrigerator.

Damnit! I don’t see the meaning, I don’t hear the words. I read out loud to myself often to make the world around me shut up. To create my own internal quiet by hearing my voice above the rest of the sounds. I inhale breath and exhale words, and somewhere in-between I hope to hear them and understand them.
I live with headphones in my ears. Most of the time I wear them, nothing is playing. I live in a loud world. A world in which my own thoughts are drowned out by the music of the pavement. My voice overwhelmed by the song of the wind, and attention diverted by the art of the sky.

I frequently hear the stern but kind voice of my father in the back of my head: Be aware of your surroundings!

Often, I’m all too aware.
