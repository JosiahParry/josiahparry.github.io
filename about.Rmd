Hello! 

I'm Josiah Parry. I am a person of eclectic interests; some of which are social science, politics, espresso, data science, and music. I get to indulge in some of these interests as a Customer Success Representative at RStudio.

I am also a Master of Science Candidate at Northeastern University studying Urban Informatics in the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs under [Dr. Dan O'Brien](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/people/faculty/daniel-t-obrien/).


If you would like to [sponsor a cup of coffee](https://ko-fi.com/josiahparry), I'd greatly appreciate it :)
